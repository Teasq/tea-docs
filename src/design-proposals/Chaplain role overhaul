## Overview
This document will propose several ideas I've been thinking up for quite some time regarding the chaplain's role on the station, but the key points are:

• Chaplain will become a mini head of staff, similar to the magister, with one predominant role: enforcing what magic is legal/considered evil and what religion is sanctioned aboard the station.
The reason for this being that there currently isn't an authority on magics as of the removal of EOC and navigating magic use in general has been confusing for many.
• Similarly to the nullrod, chaplain will - preferably roundstart - select a sect. This sect defines the flavour of whatever religion they decide to practice this shift. 
More details on sects below and will be expanded as I get more ideas/feedback
• Chaplain will have a small group of acolytes, likely 1-3, who follow the chaplain and whatever sect they decide upon. They will be notably less capable than the chaplain, 
but can act as the chaplain's successor in the event of their permanent death or when they cryo/SSD. They will also be vulnerable to cult mind control and other magics that the chaplain is normally impervious to.
